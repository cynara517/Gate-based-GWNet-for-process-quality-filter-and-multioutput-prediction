# Gate-based-GWNet-for-process-quality-filter-and-multioutput-prediction
A repository containing the code implementation and the dataset of the Gate-based GWNet model for process quality filter and multioutput prediction, as described in the paper.
# Abstract
Industrial fermentation is a crucial process for producing commonly used drugs like penicillin. The Gate-based GWNet model addresses the challenges of capturing complex relationships and dynamic changes within fermentation processes. It introduces innovative modules for graph structure acquisition, time gating, dynamic graph structure updating, and adaptive filtering of temporal features. The model is evaluated on three industrial fermentation datasets, showcasing superior performance compared to existing models like MTGNN and Autoformer.
